# HealthStash Security Report - User Data Isolation

## Executive Summary
✅ **CONFIRMED: User data is properly isolated. Different users CANNOT see each other's records.**

## Security Implementation Details

### 1. Database Level Protection

#### Foreign Key Constraint
```sql
Foreign-key constraint: "health_records_user_id_fkey" 
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
```
- Every health record MUST have a valid user_id
- Records are automatically deleted if user is deleted (CASCADE)
- Database enforces referential integrity

#### Indexes for Performance
```sql
Index: "idx_health_records_user_id" btree (user_id)
```
- Fast lookups by user_id ensure efficient filtering

### 2. API Level Protection

#### Authentication Required
All record endpoints require authentication via JWT token:
```python
current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
```

#### User Filtering Applied
Every query filters by the authenticated user's ID:
```python
query = db.query(HealthRecord).filter(
    HealthRecord.user_id == current_user.id,
    HealthRecord.is_deleted == False
)
```

#### Endpoints with Verified User Isolation
- ✅ `GET /api/records/` - Lists only current user's records
- ✅ `POST /api/records/` - Creates record with current user's ID
- ✅ `GET /api/records/{id}` - Returns 404 if record belongs to another user
- ✅ `PATCH /api/records/{id}/*` - Updates only if owned by current user
- ✅ `DELETE /api/records/{id}` - Deletes only if owned by current user
- ✅ `GET /api/records/search` - Searches only within user's records
- ✅ `GET /api/records/timeline` - Shows only user's timeline
- ✅ `GET /api/records/stats` - Statistics for user's records only
- ✅ `GET /api/files/*` - File operations restricted to user's files

### 3. Test Results

#### Isolation Test Results
```
✅ User 1 can see their own record but NOT User 2's record
✅ User 2 can see their own record but NOT User 1's record
✅ User 1 CANNOT access User 2's record (Status: 404)
✅ User 2 CANNOT access User 1's record (Status: 404)
✅ User 1 cannot find User 2's private data via search
✅ User 2 cannot find User 1's private data via search
```

### 4. Additional Security Features

#### Password Security
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- Minimum 12 character requirement
- Password reset requires admin privileges

#### Token Security
- JWT tokens with expiration
- Refresh token mechanism
- Token required for all protected endpoints

#### File Security
- Files stored with user-specific paths in MinIO
- File metadata includes user_id
- Download links require authentication

### 5. Potential Security Considerations

#### Strengths
✅ Database-level foreign key constraints
✅ Application-level user filtering
✅ Consistent security across all endpoints
✅ No SQL injection vulnerabilities (using ORM)
✅ Search queries properly scoped to user

#### Recommendations for Enhancement
1. **Audit Logging**: Track all access attempts
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent brute force attacks
3. **Encryption**: Consider encrypting sensitive data at rest
4. **2FA**: Add two-factor authentication for additional security
5. **Session Management**: Implement session timeout and concurrent session limits

## Conclusion

The HealthStash application **properly enforces user data isolation** at multiple levels:
1. **Database constraints** prevent orphaned or incorrectly assigned records
2. **API middleware** ensures all queries are filtered by authenticated user
3. **Testing confirms** no cross-user data leakage

**Verdict: SECURE** - Users cannot see, access, or search for other users' health records.
